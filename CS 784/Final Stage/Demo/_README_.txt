This directory contains sample datasets, labeled candidate set, final matches,  and a ipython notebook file that would help the user to get familiar with matcher part of Magellan.

There are two sample datasets: ACM.csv and DBLP.csv, a ipython notebook file: workflow-matcher.ipynb , candidate set : tableC.csv, labeled candidate set: candidate_set.csv and the final matches file final_matches.csv

To play around with Magellan, first download the sample files and ipython notebook to some local directory. 

Start ipython notebook from the directory where the sample files were downloaded. 

Open the  workflow-matcher.ipynb file and modify the input table paths. 
Start executing each code-cell and feel free to modify the parameters and check the result. 

If you have any questions or face any issues, please feel free to mail pradap@cs.wisc.edu
